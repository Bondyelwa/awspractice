Practice using AWS 
by Luke Simmons


Use this code to help you set up a new GET method on AWS Lambda to connect to API Gateway.
The comments in the code should help you understand each step in the process.
The print statements are only necessary for understanding and posting log infromation to CloudWatch.
This is a very basic GET function that has no security or real error handling in place. This code is simply to help
understand what is happening in Lambda/API Gateway when they interact.
